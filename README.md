# Pair

A Product Type that allows you to hold and use two values in one type. This useful for working with more than one related value similar to tuple or list, but since it is limited to only two values the API is more focused.

There are many uses for the Pair type and, if you know of a good one that is not below please add a PR. I use the Pair type primarily for computations on values that have "metadata" or some extra information about the value that needs to travel with it.
